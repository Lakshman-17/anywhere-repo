Text Editor For Macro

TO-DO List

Things to keep note on : 

- Which languages are supported
- Tokens in the language - Keywords(var,func,etc..), syntax
- Related libraries which contain the things needed for the code in that language
- At the time of typing itself, compare the text typed with the token list, to find what is the text typed and apply styles accordingly
- 


Features to add :

- Apply colors to differentiate tokens in the code (runtime)
- User defined color palettes for applying colors
- Undo, Redo

- Save, Run
- Goto - line, functions, class, etc..
- List of functions present in code
- Autocomplete suggestions
- Find and replace
- Auto indentation

- Hint about function (i.e. desc about the fun) when hovered
- Pretty text (align text automatically based on brackets if not aligned code is found)
- Bookmark

- Miniature of code in right side (like in sublime text)
- Switch themes (light, dark, etc..)
- Show errors or warnings in code during runtime (i.e. wrong syntax eg. eclipse, android studio, etc..)
- Get details about some functions and classes in library (eg. ctrl+click in android studio to view the class)

- Full screen mode
- Pic-in-pic (pip) mode (or) Floating mode
- Custom scroll bar
- Display user details, version history
- Console for viewing errors
- Blocks mode - Reorder code easily by blocks mode (select an area of text and change it to block and move them by drag and drop, like in jupyter notebook)
- Show number of - class, functions, words, lines
- Wireframe of the code (show links of how things are interconnected)
- Help menu
- Display list of variables, functions of the class at right side panel (like in eclipse)
