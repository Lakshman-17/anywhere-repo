create arrays : varlist
	if var is found and also = is found
		find the variable name between var and =
	for storing the variable names along with the type of it 
		(but how to get the type)
	
find the variable name or objct name or class name before . when . is pressed

after var declarations everytime , assign the type to the variable name and store in varlist

when . is presses after ] (i.e) at end of list/array
	check if brackets is balanced then show functions fr array (todo)
